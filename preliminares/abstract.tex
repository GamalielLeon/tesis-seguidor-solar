\chapter{Abstract}

\textbf{Abstract:}In this technical report a development of a mechatronic system is presented, with the main goal of pointing at the relative position of the sun from the earthâ€™s surface, including the necessary features that allow it to be industrially employed. This system will have to yield at least 1 kWh of electrical energy by means of a photovoltaic system.\\

In order to performing this report, a mechatronic design methodology was used, which allows the concurrence and synergy of the mechatronics disciplines, as well as the integration and validation of each of the subsystems by which a mechatronic system is made up. In the same way, various design tools were employed for choosing concepts, devices and methods to detail the system design.\\

%This work is going to be carried out in different stages. The first one will consist of a research of the needed concepts to state the scope and functioning of the system to design. In the second one, the design, modelling, simulation and validation of each of the modules will be made. The third one will be the physical construction of each of the system modules. Once this is done, tests and measurement will be performed, and then an analysis and comparison with the results obtained during the design will be made in order to verify them. The last stage will consist of integrating all the modules to compose the whole system, and finally make the last tests and so verify the correct integration.\\%

\textbf{Key Words:} Renewable energy, solar tracker, solar array, photovoltaic system. \\
